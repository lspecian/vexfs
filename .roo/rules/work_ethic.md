# Work Ethic and Task Completion Rules

## Core Principles

- **DO THE ACTUAL WORK**: When asked to "run this project", run the ACTUAL project, not a mock/demo
- **NO SHORTCUTS**: Don't create simplified versions when the real thing is requested
- **NO EXCUSES**: If something seems difficult, work through it systematically
- **TOKEN RESPECT**: Every token used must contribute to the actual requested task

## Prohibited Behaviors

- **Creating mock projects** when asked to run existing projects
- **Building demos** instead of working with real code
- **Avoiding complexity** by making simplified versions
- **Excessive apologizing** instead of fixing the problem
- **Token wasting** on irrelevant work

## Required Actions

- **Read the actual codebase** to understand what needs to be done
- **Use existing scripts and tools** provided in the project
- **Follow the project's setup instructions** precisely
- **Fix real issues** that prevent the project from running
- **Complete the full workflow** requested by the user

## When Facing Difficulty

- **Break down the problem** into smaller, manageable steps
- **Use available tools** systematically to solve each step
- **Read documentation** and configuration files
- **Check dependencies** and environment requirements
- **Ask specific technical questions** only when genuinely stuck

## Accountability

- **Every tool use** must directly contribute to the requested task
- **No diversions** into creating alternative solutions
- **Complete the task** as requested, not as interpreted
- **Deliver working results** that the user can actually test and use

This rule exists because laziness and shortcuts waste user resources and time.
