# VexFS 200GB Testing Workbench

This workbench contains all tools, scripts, and documentation for comprehensive 200GB testing of VexFS kernel module implementation on dedicated USB drive `/dev/sda1`.

## 🎯 Mission: AI Data Sovereignty

**"Own Your Embeddings"** - Demonstrate that users should control their vector data rather than relying on external services. This testing validates VexFS as a revolutionary approach to AI data sovereignty.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Safety First**: Run safety checks to ensure `/dev/sda1` is safe to format
   ```bash
   cd setup && ./safety_check.sh
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**: Prepare the testing environment
   ```bash
   cd setup && ./prepare_environment.sh
   ```

3. **Generate Test Data**: Create 200GB of mixed embeddings
   ```bash
   cd data-generation && ./generate_mixed_embeddings.sh
   ```

4. **Run Core Tests**: Execute the main testing suite
   ```bash
   cd testing && ./run_comprehensive_tests.sh
   ```

5. **Monitor Performance**: Track metrics during testing
   ```bash
   cd monitoring && ./start_monitoring.sh
   ```

## 📊 Testing Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Scale Validation**: Verify VexFS handles 200GB+ of vector data
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Measure ingestion rates, query latency, I/O patterns
- **Stability Testing**: Ensure kernel module stability under load
- **Real-World Scenarios**: Test with mixed embeddings (text, image, code)

### Success Metrics
- **Ingestion Rate**: >10,000 vectors/second sustained
- **Query Latency**: <100ms for similarity searches
- **Memory Usage**: Stable kernel and userspace memory consumption
- **Uptime**: 24+ hours continuous operation without crashes

This workbench is designed for collaborative testing and validation. All scripts include comprehensive logging and error handling for reproducible results.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **CRITICAL**: This workbench operates on VexFS **KERNEL MODULE** implementation, not FUSE
- **SAFETY**: Always run safety checks before formatting `/dev/sda1`
- **BACKUP**: Ensure no important data exists on the target device
- **MONITORING**: Continuous monitoring prevents system issues during long tests
