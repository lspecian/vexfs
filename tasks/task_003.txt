# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Core File System Logic
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core file system operations for managing files and directories
# Details:
1. Implement file operations (read, write, open, close, etc.)
2. Develop directory operations (create, lookup, unlink, etc.)
3. Implement inode management
4. Create block allocation and management system
5. Implement basic journaling for crash recovery
6. Design and implement on-disk format

The implementation should focus on POSIX compliance while preparing for vector extensions. Use memory-safe abstractions for file operations and ensure proper locking for concurrent access.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test standard file operations (create, read, write, delete)
2. Verify directory operations (mkdir, rmdir, ls)
3. Test concurrent access patterns
4. Validate crash recovery mechanisms
5. Benchmark basic file operations against ext4
6. Verify POSIX compliance with standard test suites
