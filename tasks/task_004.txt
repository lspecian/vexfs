# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Vector Embedding Storage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the storage mechanism for vector embeddings, including on-disk format and association with source files.
# Details:
1. Design on-disk format for vector embeddings storage
2. Implement storage allocation for embeddings
3. Create mechanisms to link embeddings to their source files
4. Develop storage for vector metadata (dimensionality, model version, etc.)
5. Implement efficient serialization/deserialization of vector data
6. Create mechanisms for vector data compression/quantization
7. Implement columnar storage layout for vectors if appropriate
8. Develop mechanisms for vector data integrity verification

Consider multiple approaches for embedding storage:
- Extended attributes (xattrs) for smaller embeddings
- Dedicated vector store within VexFS for larger embeddings
- Support for memory-mapped (mmap) access to embeddings

Defer sparse vector storage support for future development unless strong early demand is identified.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test storage and retrieval of vectors of various dimensions
2. Verify correct association between files and their embeddings
3. Test vector data integrity after file operations
4. Benchmark vector storage and retrieval performance
5. Verify correct handling of vector metadata
6. Test concurrent vector operations
7. Validate storage efficiency through compression/quantization
8. Test mmap access to vector data if implemented

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Vector On-Disk Format [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a specification for the on-disk format to store vector embeddings efficiently
### Details:
Design a binary format that supports variable-length vectors with different dimensions. Include header structures with metadata (vector dimension, data type, creation timestamp). Consider memory alignment for optimal read performance. Implement versioning to support format evolution. Evaluate trade-offs between dense and sparse vector storage formats. Benchmark read/write performance with different block sizes (4KB, 8KB, 16KB) to optimize for both SSD and HDD storage. Document the byte-level layout with diagrams.

## 2. Implement Storage Allocation Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop efficient allocation strategies for vector data that minimize fragmentation and optimize access patterns
### Details:
Create a vector-specific allocation manager that handles variable-sized embeddings. Implement a buddy allocation system for vectors with similar dimensions. Design a paging mechanism with configurable page sizes (default 64KB). Develop strategies for handling vector updates (copy-on-write vs. in-place updates). Implement garbage collection for deleted vectors. Create benchmarks to measure fragmentation over time with different allocation strategies. Optimize for batch operations when storing multiple vectors simultaneously.

## 3. Develop File-to-Embedding Linking System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Create a robust system to maintain relationships between file objects and their vector embeddings
### Details:
Design a bidirectional mapping between file IDs and vector embeddings. Implement a persistent B-tree index for fast lookups. Support one-to-many relationships (multiple embeddings per file). Create a caching layer for frequently accessed mappings. Implement transactional updates to maintain consistency between files and embeddings. Design recovery mechanisms for interrupted operations. Support bulk operations for efficiency when processing multiple files. Include versioning to track embedding updates over time.

## 4. Implement Vector Metadata Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.3
### Description: Create a system to store, index, and query metadata associated with vector embeddings
### Details:
Design a schema for vector metadata (source, model version, confidence scores, timestamps). Implement a columnar storage format for efficient queries on specific metadata fields. Create indexes for common query patterns. Support both structured and semi-structured metadata. Implement a query language for metadata filtering. Design a versioning system to track metadata changes. Optimize storage with compression techniques specific to metadata types. Create a caching strategy for frequently accessed metadata.

## 5. Develop Vector Serialization and Compression [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Implement efficient serialization and compression techniques for vector data to minimize storage requirements
### Details:
Research and implement vector-specific compression algorithms (quantization, dimensionality reduction, sparse encoding). Create a pluggable compression framework to support multiple algorithms. Implement adaptive compression based on vector characteristics. Benchmark compression ratio vs. decompression speed for different algorithms. Support both lossy and lossless compression options with configurable quality settings. Implement batched compression/decompression for improved throughput. Create utilities for analyzing compression effectiveness across different vector types. Optimize for SIMD instructions where applicable.
