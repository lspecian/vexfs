# Task ID: 4
# Title: Design and Implement Vector Storage Format
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the storage format and management system for vector embeddings within the file system
# Details:
1. Design on-disk format for vector embeddings
2. Implement vector metadata structures
3. Create storage allocation strategy for vectors
4. Develop vector compression/quantization mechanisms
5. Implement columnar storage layout for efficient vector operations
6. Design vector-to-file mapping system

The storage format should optimize for both space efficiency and query performance. Consider different vector dimensions and types, and implement appropriate compression techniques based on vector characteristics.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test storage and retrieval of vectors with different dimensions
2. Benchmark compression ratios for various vector types
3. Verify data integrity after compression/decompression
4. Test vector storage with large datasets
5. Validate mapping between files and their vector embeddings
