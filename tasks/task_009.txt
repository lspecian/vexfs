# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Caching Mechanisms for Vector Data
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop efficient caching strategies for vector embeddings and index structures
# Details:
1. Implement kernel memory caches for vector embeddings
2. Develop caching for ANNS index segments
3. Create cache eviction policies
4. Implement prefetching strategies
5. Develop cache coherence mechanisms
6. Optimize memory usage for cached vectors

The caching system should balance memory usage with performance, adapting to available system resources. Implement different caching strategies for different access patterns.

# Test Strategy:
1. Benchmark query performance with and without caching
2. Test cache hit/miss rates under various workloads
3. Verify memory consumption stays within bounds
4. Test cache behavior under memory pressure
5. Validate cache coherence during concurrent operations
6. Measure cache warm-up time
