# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Basic Userspace Embedding Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a reference implementation of a userspace embedding service that can generate embeddings for common file types.
# Details:
1. Implement a userspace daemon that listens for embedding requests
2. Create handlers for common file types (text, images)
3. Integrate with a simple embedding model (e.g., MiniLM for text)
4. Implement IPC communication with the kernel module
5. Develop request processing and response generation
6. Create configuration mechanisms for model selection
7. Implement service registration with the kernel module
8. Add logging and monitoring capabilities

The implementation should be modular to allow for easy extension with additional file types and embedding models. Focus on stability and resource efficiency.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test embedding generation for various file types
2. Verify correct communication with the kernel module
3. Benchmark embedding generation performance
4. Test service startup and shutdown
5. Verify resource usage under load
6. Test with malformed or corrupted files
7. Validate configuration mechanisms
8. Test service recovery after crashes
