# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Userspace Embedding Service Orchestration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the kernel-side orchestration for communicating with userspace embedding services via IPC mechanisms.
# Details:
1. Design IPC protocol for kernel-userspace communication (Netlink recommended)
2. Implement kernel-side IPC handlers
3. Create embedding request/response message formats
4. Develop service discovery and management
5. Implement request queuing and prioritization
6. Create timeout and error handling mechanisms
7. Develop embedding result processing and storage
8. Implement service health monitoring

The implementation should isolate complex model execution in userspace while providing efficient communication channels. The kernel module should be resilient to userspace service failures and provide appropriate fallback mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test communication with mock userspace services
2. Verify correct handling of service failures
3. Test request queuing and prioritization
4. Benchmark IPC performance
5. Test concurrent embedding requests
6. Verify timeout handling
7. Test with various message sizes
8. Validate embedding result processing

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement IPC Protocol [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a robust IPC protocol for communication between kernel modules and userspace embedding services
### Details:
Develop a protocol specification document detailing message formats (using Protocol Buffers or FlatBuffers), communication channels (netlink sockets, shared memory, or character devices), serialization/deserialization mechanisms, and versioning strategy. Implement client and server libraries in C/C++ with proper memory management. Include authentication mechanisms and implement bandwidth throttling to prevent DoS. Define timeout handling and heartbeat mechanisms for connection health monitoring.

## 2. Implement Service Discovery and Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create a service registry and management system for embedding services
### Details:
Develop a service registry that maintains information about available embedding services, their capabilities, and current status. Implement dynamic service registration/deregistration with health checking. Create a configuration system for service parameters using YAML/JSON. Design load balancing mechanisms for distributing requests across multiple service instances. Implement graceful startup/shutdown procedures and service versioning to handle upgrades without downtime.

## 3. Develop Request Handling and Prioritization [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Create a request processing pipeline with prioritization and queueing mechanisms
### Details:
Implement a request queue with priority levels (high/medium/low) and fair scheduling algorithm. Create backpressure mechanisms to handle overload conditions. Develop request batching for improved throughput. Implement cancellation mechanisms for in-flight requests. Add instrumentation for performance metrics (latency, throughput, queue depth). Create configurable timeout policies per request type and priority level.

## 4. Implement Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Design comprehensive error handling and recovery strategies for the embedding service
### Details:
Create an error classification system (transient vs. permanent failures). Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient errors. Develop circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures. Create fallback mechanisms for degraded operation modes. Implement detailed error logging and diagnostics. Design and implement automated recovery procedures for common failure scenarios. Create an alert system for critical failures requiring manual intervention.
