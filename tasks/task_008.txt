# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Userspace Embedding Service IPC
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the inter-process communication mechanism between the kernel module and userspace embedding services
# Details:
1. Design IPC protocol for kernel-userspace communication
2. Implement kernel-side IPC endpoints
3. Create service discovery mechanism
4. Develop request/response handling
5. Implement timeout and error handling
6. Create service registration and management

The IPC mechanism should be efficient and secure, with proper validation of data crossing the kernel-userspace boundary. Consider using netlink sockets or character devices for communication.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test communication latency between kernel and userspace
2. Verify handling of service unavailability
3. Test recovery from service crashes
4. Validate data integrity across the boundary
5. Test with multiple concurrent embedding services
6. Verify security of the IPC channel
