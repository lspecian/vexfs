# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Data Integrity and Security Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop security features including access control, data encryption, and vector data integrity mechanisms.
# Details:
1. Implement at-rest encryption for file and vector data
2. Create secure key management mechanisms
3. Develop POSIX ACL support
4. Implement checksums for vector data integrity
5. Create Copy-on-Write (CoW) mechanisms for atomic updates
6. Implement snapshot capabilities ("time travel")
7. Develop scrubbing mechanisms for data integrity verification
8. Create secure audit logging

The implementation should prioritize security without compromising performance. The CoW and snapshot capabilities are particularly important for supporting the "time travel" functionality needed for agent memory simulation.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test encryption with various key sizes and algorithms
2. Verify ACL enforcement
3. Test data integrity after simulated corruption
4. Validate CoW behavior during concurrent updates
5. Test snapshot creation and restoration
6. Verify scrubbing functionality
7. Test audit logging accuracy
8. Validate security under various attack scenarios
