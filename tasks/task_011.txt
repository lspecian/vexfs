# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Security and Access Control
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop security features including encryption, access control, and data integrity mechanisms
# Details:
1. Implement at-rest encryption for vector data
2. Develop POSIX permission checks for vector operations
3. Implement POSIX ACL support
4. Create capability-based access control for ioctl operations
5. Implement checksums for data integrity
6. Develop secure key management for encryption

Security implementation should follow kernel security best practices. Ensure proper permission checking for all operations and secure handling of cryptographic materials.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test permission enforcement for various user/group combinations
2. Verify encryption effectiveness with data inspection
3. Test ACL functionality for complex permission scenarios
4. Validate checksum verification during data retrieval
5. Test key rotation procedures
6. Verify security of ioctl operations with unprivileged users
