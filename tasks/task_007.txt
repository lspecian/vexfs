# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement ioctl Interface for Vector Operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the ioctl-based API for vector operations in the file system
# Details:
1. Define ioctl command codes and structures
2. Implement VEXFS_IOCTL_ADD_EMBEDDING
3. Implement VEXFS_IOCTL_GET_EMBEDDING
4. Implement VEXFS_IOCTL_UPDATE_EMBEDDING
5. Implement VEXFS_IOCTL_DELETE_EMBEDDING
6. Implement VEXFS_IOCTL_VECTOR_SEARCH
7. Implement VEXFS_IOCTL_HYBRID_SEARCH
8. Implement VEXFS_IOCTL_MANAGE_INDEX

Ensure proper input validation and error handling. Design the API to be extensible for future operations while maintaining backward compatibility.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test each ioctl command with valid and invalid inputs
2. Verify proper error codes are returned for edge cases
3. Test permission handling and access control
4. Benchmark ioctl performance overhead
5. Validate memory safety during ioctl operations
6. Test concurrent ioctl calls
