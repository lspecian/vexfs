# Task ID: 7
# Title: Design and Implement ioctl Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the ioctl-based API for vector operations, providing a secure and efficient interface for userspace applications.
# Details:
1. Define ioctl command codes for all vector operations
2. Implement core vector operations:
   - VEXFS_IOCTL_ADD_EMBEDDING
   - VEXFS_IOCTL_GET_EMBEDDING
   - VEXFS_IOCTL_UPDATE_EMBEDDING
   - VEXFS_IOCTL_DELETE_EMBEDDING
   - VEXFS_IOCTL_VECTOR_SEARCH
   - VEXFS_IOCTL_HYBRID_SEARCH
   - VEXFS_IOCTL_MANAGE_INDEX
3. Create data structures for ioctl parameters and results
4. Implement rigorous input validation
5. Add permission and capability checks
6. Develop secure error reporting
7. Optimize for minimal copying between kernel and userspace
8. Implement batched operations where appropriate

The implementation should follow the principle of least privilege and ensure that all user inputs are thoroughly validated to prevent security vulnerabilities.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test each ioctl command with valid and invalid inputs
2. Verify proper permission checking
3. Test error handling and reporting
4. Benchmark performance of ioctl operations
5. Test concurrent ioctl calls
6. Verify memory safety during ioctl processing
7. Test with malformed or malicious inputs (fuzzing)
8. Validate behavior with edge case parameters

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design ioctl Command Set and Data Structures [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the complete ioctl command set and associated data structures for vector operations
### Details:
Create a comprehensive API design document that includes: 1) Command codes for all vector operations (add, subtract, multiply, etc.), 2) Data structures for passing vector data between userspace and kernel, 3) Error code definitions, 4) Documentation of parameter requirements. Include memory layout considerations for efficient data transfer and alignment requirements. Design should account for both small and large vector operations.

## 2. Implement Core Vector Operation Handlers [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop the kernel-side handlers for each vector operation defined in the ioctl interface
### Details:
Implement efficient C functions for each vector operation that: 1) Extract parameters from the ioctl call, 2) Perform the requested vector calculation, 3) Copy results back to userspace. Include optimizations like SIMD instructions where appropriate. Create a dispatch mechanism in the module's ioctl handler to route commands to the appropriate implementation. Develop unit tests for each operation using kernel testing frameworks.

## 3. Implement Security and Validation Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Add comprehensive input validation, permission checking, and security hardening to the ioctl interface
### Details:
Implement robust security measures including: 1) Bounds checking on all vector dimensions, 2) Validation of user-provided memory addresses, 3) Proper permission verification before operations, 4) Protection against integer overflows, 5) Mitigation of potential side-channel attacks. Document all security considerations and create test cases specifically designed to verify security properties. Implement proper error handling and reporting.

## 4. Optimize Performance and Create Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Optimize the kernel-userspace data transfer and create a comprehensive testing environment
### Details:
Implement performance optimizations including: 1) Minimizing copying between kernel and userspace, 2) Using appropriate memory allocation strategies, 3) Implementing batching for multiple operations. Create a testing framework that includes: 1) Kernel module compilation setup, 2) QEMU-based testing environment, 3) Performance benchmarks comparing different vector sizes, 4) Stress tests for concurrent operations. Document performance characteristics and provide usage examples.
