# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Vector Indexing Module (ANNS)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) indexing functionality optimized for in-kernel execution.
# Details:
1. Implement at least one ANNS algorithm (HNSW recommended for initial implementation)
2. Design on-disk serialization format for ANNS indices
3. Implement index building and update mechanisms
4. Create efficient partial loading of indices
5. Develop batch and incremental indexing support
6. Implement index persistence and recovery
7. Create tunable parameters for index performance
8. Optimize for kernel execution environment

The implementation should focus on memory efficiency and performance within kernel constraints. Consider implementing a Vector Write-Ahead Log (WAL) to decouple embedding ingestion from index updates, particularly useful for handling bursts of embedding updates.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test index building with various vector dimensions and counts
2. Verify index persistence across mount/unmount cycles
3. Benchmark search performance with different index configurations
4. Test incremental index updates
5. Verify index integrity after crashes or power failures
6. Test concurrent index operations
7. Validate memory usage during index operations
8. Compare search results against reference implementations for accuracy
