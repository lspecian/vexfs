# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement ANNS Algorithms for Vector Indexing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) algorithms for efficient vector indexing and retrieval
# Details:
1. Implement HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm
2. Develop IVFADC (Inverted File System with Additive Distance Computation) indexing
3. Implement DiskANN for SSD-optimized vector search
4. Create index management and maintenance routines
5. Develop index persistence mechanisms
6. Implement index parameter tuning interfaces

The implementation should focus on kernel-compatible algorithms that minimize memory allocations and maximize performance. Consider read-optimized and update-optimized index variants.

# Test Strategy:
1. Benchmark search performance against standard vector datasets
2. Test index building with varying parameters
3. Validate search accuracy (recall@k) for different algorithms
4. Measure memory consumption during index operations
5. Test index persistence across mount/unmount cycles
6. Verify concurrent search operations
