# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Vector Search and Retrieval
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the in-kernel vector search functionality, including similarity metrics, query processing, and result filtering.
# Details:
1. Implement multiple similarity metrics (L2 Distance, Cosine Similarity, Inner Product)
2. Develop k-NN search algorithm optimized for in-kernel execution
3. Implement filtering based on file metadata
4. Create hybrid search logic to combine metadata and vector search results
5. Optimize search performance for kernel environment
6. Implement batched search requests
7. Develop query-aware pruning techniques
8. Create mechanisms for search result scoring and ranking

The implementation should leverage SIMD instructions where available for vector operations. Focus on minimizing memory allocations and copies during search operations.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test search accuracy for various similarity metrics
2. Benchmark search performance with different vector dimensions and dataset sizes
3. Verify correct filtering based on file metadata
4. Test hybrid search functionality
5. Validate search results against reference implementations
6. Test concurrent search operations
7. Measure memory usage during search operations
8. Test edge cases like empty indices or extreme parameter values

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement secure ioctl interface for vector operations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a secure kernel ioctl interface that handles vector operation requests from user space while enforcing proper access controls and validation.
### Details:
Implement a kernel module with ioctl handlers that validate all incoming requests. Define command codes for vector operations (search, insert, delete). Implement input validation including bounds checking, permission verification, and buffer safety. Use copy_from_user/copy_to_user for safe data transfer. Add proper locking mechanisms for concurrent access. Document the API interface with clear parameter specifications.

## 2. Implement SIMD-optimized vector similarity metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop kernel-compatible vector similarity functions optimized with SIMD instructions for various distance metrics.
### Details:
Implement cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, dot product, and Jaccard similarity metrics. Use architecture-specific SIMD instructions (AVX2/AVX-512 for x86, NEON for ARM). Create fallback implementations for systems without SIMD support. Benchmark each implementation against naive versions. Ensure proper alignment of memory for optimal SIMD performance. Add kernel configuration options to select metrics at runtime.

## 3. Develop k-NN search algorithm with metadata filtering [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Create an efficient k-nearest neighbors search implementation with support for metadata-based filtering in the kernel space.
### Details:
Implement priority queue for maintaining top-k results. Add support for early termination optimizations. Create efficient index structures for vector storage (consider inverted indices or partition-based approaches). Implement metadata filtering that can be applied during or after vector similarity search. Optimize memory usage for kernel environment. Add support for batch processing of queries. Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms.

## 4. Create result scoring, ranking and validation framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Develop a comprehensive system for scoring, ranking and validating vector search results before returning them to user space.
### Details:
Implement configurable scoring algorithms that combine similarity scores with metadata relevance. Create a ranking system that sorts results based on combined scores. Add result validation to ensure returned data meets quality thresholds. Implement pagination support for large result sets. Create comprehensive logging for search performance metrics. Design and implement unit tests for accuracy validation. Add support for returning confidence scores with results.
