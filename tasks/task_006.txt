# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Vector Search and Retrieval Functions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement vector similarity search functions using different distance metrics
# Details:
1. Implement L2 Distance (Euclidean) calculation
2. Develop Cosine Similarity computation
3. Implement Inner Product similarity
4. Create k-nearest neighbor search functionality
5. Develop range search capabilities
6. Implement search result filtering and sorting

Optimize vector operations for kernel execution, potentially using SIMD instructions where available. Implement both exact and approximate search variants with configurable accuracy-performance tradeoffs.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test search accuracy with known vector pairs
2. Benchmark search performance with varying dataset sizes
3. Validate different distance metrics against reference implementations
4. Test edge cases (zero vectors, identical vectors)
5. Verify search with different k values
6. Test performance under concurrent search load
