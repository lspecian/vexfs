# Task ID: 15
# Title: Develop Comprehensive Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a testing framework for validating VexFS functionality, performance, and compliance
# Details:
1. Implement unit tests for kernel module components
2. Develop integration tests with VFS
3. Create performance benchmarking suite
4. Implement POSIX compliance test suite
5. Develop stress tests and fuzz testing
6. Create data integrity and crash recovery tests

The testing framework should provide comprehensive coverage of file system functionality. Implement automated test execution in QEMU environments and reporting of results.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run tests in CI/CD pipeline
2. Verify test coverage metrics
3. Validate test reproducibility
4. Test the tests themselves for false positives/negatives
5. Benchmark test execution time
6. Verify isolation between test cases
