# Title: Comprehensive Testing and Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive testing suites and documentation for the VexFS file system, including performance benchmarks, correctness tests, and user guides.
# Details:
1. Develop unit tests for all components
2. Create integration tests for the complete system
3. Implement performance benchmarks
4. Develop POSIX compliance tests
5. Create stress tests for reliability
6. Implement fuzz testing for security
7. Develop correctness tests for vector operations
8. Create data integrity and crash recovery tests

Documentation:
1. API reference for ioctl interface
2. User guide for vexctl tool
3. Administrator guide for mounting and managing VexFS
4. Developer guide for extending VexFS
5. Performance tuning guide
6. Security best practices
7. Use case examples for different applications
8. Troubleshooting guide

The testing should be rigorous and comprehensive, given the critical nature of a kernel module. Documentation should be clear, concise, and complete.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify test coverage across all components
2. Validate test results against expected behavior
3. Test documentation accuracy and completeness
4. Gather feedback from test users
5. Verify benchmark reproducibility
6. Test documentation examples
7. Validate troubleshooting procedures
8. Test in various environments and configurations
