# Task ID: 14
# Title: Create Agentic Boot Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 6, 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop bootable semantic substrates for AGI alignment, including pre-mounted and pre-indexed VexFS with vectorized knowledge artifacts.
# Details:
1. Create QEMU images with VexFS pre-mounted
2. Develop scripts for pre-indexing knowledge artifacts
3. Implement a baseline AI agent that reads/writes from VexFS
4. Create mechanisms for storing "thoughts," queries, and embeddings
5. Implement semantic time-travel using filesystem snapshots
6. Develop safe rollback mechanisms
7. Create agent memory simulation environment
8. Implement monitoring and analysis tools

This environment is not user-facing but rather simulates how future intelligent systems will interact with data semantically and persistently. It leverages the snapshot capabilities developed in task 11 to enable episodic memory and safe rollback.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test boot process of semantic substrate images
2. Verify pre-indexing of knowledge artifacts
3. Test AI agent interaction with VexFS
4. Validate storage and retrieval of agent memory
5. Test semantic time-travel functionality
6. Verify safe rollback mechanisms
7. Measure performance of agent memory operations
8. Test with various knowledge artifact sets
