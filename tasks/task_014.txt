# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Packer-based Image Build Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: low
# Description: Create an automated build pipeline for generating bootable Linux images with VexFS preinstalled
# Details:
1. Set up Packer configuration for minimal Linux images
2. Implement custom kernel compilation with VexFS support
3. Create provisioning scripts for VexFS module installation
4. Develop configuration for automatic VexFS mounting
5. Implement test harness integration
6. Create image validation procedures

The build pipeline should produce consistent, reproducible images for development and testing. Include options for different kernel versions and configurations.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify image boot process in QEMU
2. Test automatic mounting of VexFS
3. Validate kernel module loading
4. Test image with different hardware configurations
5. Verify reproducibility of builds
6. Measure build time and image size
