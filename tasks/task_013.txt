# Task ID: 13
# Title: Develop Hybrid Query Optimizer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a query optimizer for hybrid searches combining traditional file attributes with vector similarity
# Details:
1. Design query representation format
2. Implement query parsing and validation
3. Develop cost-based optimization strategies
4. Create execution plan generation
5. Implement result merging and ranking
6. Develop filter pushdown optimizations

The query optimizer should efficiently combine traditional metadata filters with vector similarity searches. Implement statistics collection to inform optimization decisions.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test query optimization with various query patterns
2. Benchmark performance against naive execution strategies
3. Verify result correctness for complex queries
4. Test optimizer adaptability to data distribution
5. Validate handling of edge cases (empty results, large result sets)
6. Measure optimization overhead
