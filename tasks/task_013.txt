# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Hybrid Query Optimizer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop a query optimizer for efficiently executing hybrid queries that combine metadata and vector search operations.
# Details:
1. Design a simplified query language or API for hybrid queries
2. Implement a query parser
3. Create a cost-based optimizer
4. Develop execution plans for hybrid queries
5. Implement query execution engine
6. Create result merging and ranking mechanisms
7. Develop query caching
8. Implement query monitoring and statistics

This is a more advanced feature that may be implemented in a limited form initially. The goal is to provide a thin SQL-like query layer or a DuckDB-style planner accessible via ioctl or the vexctl tool, translating simplified hybrid queries into optimized sequences of metadata and vector operations.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test query parsing with various query formats
2. Verify optimizer plan selection
3. Benchmark query execution performance
4. Test result merging and ranking accuracy
5. Validate query caching effectiveness
6. Test with complex hybrid queries
7. Verify performance statistics
8. Test concurrent query execution
