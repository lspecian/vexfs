# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Copy-on-Write and Snapshot Capabilities
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop Copy-on-Write (CoW) mechanisms for atomic updates and snapshot functionality
# Details:
1. Implement CoW for file data updates
2. Develop CoW for vector embedding modifications
3. Create snapshot creation and management
4. Implement snapshot traversal and access
5. Develop space-efficient delta storage
6. Create garbage collection for obsolete data

The CoW implementation should ensure atomic updates while minimizing space overhead. Snapshots should be efficiently stored and quickly accessible.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test atomicity of updates during concurrent access
2. Verify snapshot creation and access
3. Measure space overhead of CoW operations
4. Test snapshot performance compared to main file system
5. Validate garbage collection effectiveness
6. Test snapshot operations at scale
