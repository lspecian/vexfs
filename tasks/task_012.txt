# Task ID: 12
# Title: Optimize Performance for Vector Operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations for vector operations, including caching, SIMD acceleration, and query optimization.
# Details:
1. Implement kernel memory caches for vector embeddings
2. Create caching for ANNS index segments
3. Develop SIMD-accelerated vector operations
4. Implement query optimization techniques
5. Create memory-mapped (mmap) access to embedding data
6. Develop batching mechanisms for vector operations
7. Implement Vector Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for improved ingestion
8. Create tunable parameters for performance optimization

The implementation should leverage hardware capabilities where available while maintaining compatibility across different platforms. The mmap functionality is particularly important for enabling efficient access from userspace applications.

# Test Strategy:
1. Benchmark vector operations with and without optimizations
2. Test cache hit rates under various workloads
3. Verify SIMD acceleration on supported platforms
4. Measure query performance with different optimization techniques
5. Test mmap performance for embedding access
6. Benchmark WAL performance for ingestion
7. Validate performance tuning parameters
8. Test performance under concurrent workloads
