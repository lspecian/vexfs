# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement VFS Interface Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core VFS interface layer that will register VexFS with the Linux Virtual File System and handle standard file system operations.
# Details:
1. Implement the necessary VFS operations structure (file_system_type)
2. Create mount/unmount handlers
3. Implement superblock operations
4. Define inode operations structure
5. Implement file operations structure
6. Register the file system with the VFS
7. Implement basic directory operations (lookup, readdir)
8. Create minimal implementations of required VFS callbacks
9. Implement module init/exit functions

Code structure should follow Linux kernel conventions while leveraging Rust safety features. Use the no_std environment and appropriate kernel bindings for Rust.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test mounting and unmounting the file system
2. Verify basic directory listing functionality
3. Test creation and deletion of empty files
4. Validate proper registration with VFS
5. Check for memory leaks or reference counting issues
6. Verify proper error handling for edge cases
7. Test concurrent mount/unmount operations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement File System Registration and Mount Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the necessary structures and functions to register VexFS with the Linux kernel and handle mount/unmount operations.
### Details:

### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create the superblock structure and associated operations for VexFS.
### Details:

3. Create memory management for file handles and buffers
4. Implement proper locking for concurrent file access
5. Add Rust FFI bindings for file operation kernel functions
6. Test file operations with various access patterns and verify proper data integrity

## 5. Implement Directory Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Create the directory operations and implement functions for directory traversal and manipulation.
### Details:
1. Define `dir_operations` structure with appropriate callbacks
2. Implement `readdir()` function to iterate directory entries
