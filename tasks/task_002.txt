# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement VFS Interface Layer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the Virtual File System (VFS) interface layer to register VexFS with the Linux kernel
# Details:
1. Implement superblock operations (mount, unmount, statfs)
2. Define file system type registration structure
3. Create initialization and cleanup functions
4. Implement basic inode operations structure
5. Setup dentry operations
6. Register file system with VFS

The VFS interface should adhere to Linux kernel standards while providing the foundation for vector-aware extensions. Use Rust's type system to ensure memory safety in VFS callbacks.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test mounting and unmounting the file system
2. Verify proper registration with VFS
3. Check for resource leaks during mount/unmount cycles
4. Validate superblock information retrieval
5. Test error handling for edge cases (e.g., mounting on invalid devices)
