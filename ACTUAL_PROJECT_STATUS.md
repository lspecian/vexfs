# VexFS - Actual Project Status

## What VexFS Is
VexFS is an experimental AI-native filesystem project that aims to provide vector search capabilities at the filesystem level. It consists of two main components:
1. A Linux kernel module (in development)
2. A FUSE-based userspace implementation (partially working)

## Current Status (Honest Assessment)

### ‚úÖ What Works
- **FUSE Implementation**: Builds successfully with warnings
- **Basic filesystem operations**: Mount, file creation, directory operations (via FUSE)
- **mkfs.vexfs tool**: Can format filesystems with VexFS structures
- **Build system**: Kernel module compiles (but has runtime issues)

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work
- **Kernel Module**: Has critical bugs preventing stable operation
  - NULL pointer dereferences during mount
  - Module gets stuck in kernel after crashes
  - Requires VM testing due to system instability
  - Not ready for any production use
- **Vector Search**: Not fully implemented or tested
- **API Compatibility**: No working Qdrant/ChromaDB API implementation
- **Performance**: No verified performance benchmarks

### üöß Work in Progress
- Kernel module stability fixes
- Vector storage implementation
- Search algorithm integration
- API server implementation

## Performance Reality

### Claimed vs Actual
- **Claimed**: 361K+ operations/second
- **Actual**: No verified benchmarks available
- **FUSE Performance**: Likely in the range of 1-10K ops/sec (typical for FUSE)
- **Kernel Module**: Cannot be benchmarked due to crashes

### Testing Status
- Unit tests: Limited coverage
- Integration tests: Not comprehensive
- VM testing: Infrastructure exists but module crashes prevent testing
- Performance tests: No reliable results

## Components

### Kernel Module (`kernel_module/`)
- **Status**: Unstable, development only
- **Issues**: Mount crashes, NULL pointer dereferences
- **Safe Usage**: VM testing only
- **Production Ready**: No

### FUSE Implementation (`rust/src/bin/vexfs_fuse.rs`)
- **Status**: Builds but not thoroughly tested
- **Features**: Basic filesystem operations
- **Vector Support**: Not implemented
- **Production Ready**: No

### Tools
- **mkfs.vexfs**: Works for creating filesystem structures
- **vexctl**: Status unknown

## Documentation Issues
- Over 300 documentation files with conflicting information
- Many docs claim features that don't exist
- Performance claims are not verified
- Multiple "completion" reports for unfinished work

## Development Recommendations

1. **Fix kernel module crashes** before any other work
2. **Focus on one implementation** (FUSE or kernel) to completion
3. **Remove false performance claims** from all documentation
4. **Implement actual vector operations** before claiming AI features
5. **Create honest benchmarks** with real, reproducible tests

## For Contributors
If you want to contribute:
- The kernel module needs stability fixes (see `VEXFS_VM_TEST_REPORT.md`)
- FUSE implementation needs vector operation support
- Documentation needs major cleanup to reflect reality
- Performance testing framework needs to be built from scratch

## Honest Timeline
- **Current state**: Early experimental prototype
- **To minimal viable**: 3-6 months of focused development
- **To production ready**: 12+ months minimum
