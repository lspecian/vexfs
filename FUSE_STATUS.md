### Development Tools ✅
- [x] Quick start script (`quick-start.sh`)
- [x] Development setup script (`dev-setup.sh`)
- [x] Integration test suite
- [x] Docker support

- [ ] POSIX ACLs

### Vector Features
- [ ] Full HNSW implementation

- [ ] Block allocation optimization

### Integration
- [ ] Full API server integration

- [ ] Cross-component transactions
- [ ] Distributed filesystem support

## Quick Development Deployment

### Option 1: Quick Start (Simplest)
```bash
# From VexFS root directory
./quick-start.sh auto
```

### Option 2: Manual Build & Run
```bash
# Build FUSE
cd rust
cargo build --release --features fuse_support --bin vexfs_fuse

# Create mount point
mkdir -p ~/vexfs-mount

# Run FUSE (foreground with debug)
./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/vexfs_fuse ~/vexfs-mount -f -d

# In another terminal, test it
echo "test" > ~/vexfs-mount/test.txt
cat ~/vexfs-mount/test.txt
```

### Option 3: Development Setup (Full Environment)
```bash
# Run comprehensive setup
./dev-setup.sh

# Use created aliases
vexfs-start   # Start FUSE
vexfs-status  # Check status
vexfs-test    # Run tests
vexfs-stop    # Stop FUSE
```

### Option 4: Docker Development
```bash
# Build and run in Docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Or use existing Docker images
docker run -it --privileged \
  --device /dev/fuse \
  --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
  -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  vexfs-fuse:latest
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
export VEXFS_MOUNT=/path/to/mount
export VEXFS_DEBUG=true
export VEXFS_CACHE_SIZE=1048576
export VEXFS_VECTOR_DIM=384
```

### Config File (`~/.vexfs/config/fuse.conf`)
```ini
mount_point=/home/user/vexfs-mount
allow_other=false
debug=false
max_threads=4
cache_size=1048576
vector_dimensions=384
```

## Testing

### Basic Functionality Test
```bash
./tests/integration_test_suite.sh
```

### Performance Test
```bash
python3 benchmarks/fuse_benchmark.py
```

### Docker Integration Test
```bash
./tests/docker_integration_test.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Mount fails with "Transport endpoint is not connected"**
   ```bash
   fusermount3 -u ~/vexfs-mount
   ```

2. **Permission denied**
   ```bash
   # Add user to fuse group
   sudo usermod -a -G fuse $USER
   # Re-login or use: newgrp fuse
   ```

3. **Build fails with missing dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install FUSE development files
   sudo apt-get install libfuse3-dev fuse3
   ```

4. **Performance issues**
   - Enable caching in config
   - Increase thread pool size
   - Use release build (not debug)

## Production Readiness

### Current Limitations
- Not thread-safe for all operations
- Limited error recovery
- No data persistence guarantees
- Missing distributed support

### Required for Production
1. Complete thread safety audit
2. Implement proper journaling
3. Add comprehensive error handling
4. Performance optimization
5. Security hardening
6. Extensive testing

## Development Priorities

### High Priority
1. Fix remaining file operation bugs
2. Complete vector search implementation
3. Add proper caching layer
4. Implement error recovery

### Medium Priority
1. Extended attributes support
2. File locking
3. Performance optimizations
4. Better logging

### Low Priority
1. Symbolic links
2. Hard links
3. POSIX ACLs
4. Memory mapping

## Summary

The FUSE filesystem is **functional for development** but requires additional work for production use. Key missing features are advanced file operations and complete vector search integration. The quick deployment options make it easy to get started with development.

**Estimated time to production-ready**: 2-3 months of focused development
**Recommended for**: Development, testing, proof-of-concept
**Not recommended for**: Production workloads, critical data
