## üöÄ Quick Production Readiness Test

Run this to check basic production readiness:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "=== Production Readiness Check ==="

# Check for panics
echo -n "Checking for panic! calls... "
if grep -r "panic!" rust/src --include="*.rs" | grep -v "test" | grep -v "debug_assert" > /dev/null; then
    echo "‚ùå FOUND"
else
    echo "‚úÖ NONE"
fi

# Check for unwraps
echo -n "Checking for unwrap() calls... "
unwrap_count=$(grep -r "\.unwrap()" rust/src --include="*.rs" | grep -v "test" | wc -l)
echo "Found: $unwrap_count (should be < 10)"

# Check for expects
echo -n "Checking for expect() calls... "
expect_count=$(grep -r "\.expect(" rust/src --include="*.rs" | grep -v "test" | wc -l)
echo "Found: $expect_count (should be < 20)"

# Check for TODOs
echo -n "Checking for TODO comments... "
todo_count=$(grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" rust/src --include="*.rs" | wc -l)
echo "Found: $todo_count (should be < 50)"

# Check for health endpoint
echo -n "Checking for health endpoint... "
if grep -r "/health" rust/src --include="*.rs" > /dev/null; then
    echo "‚úÖ FOUND"
else
    echo "‚ùå MISSING"
fi

# Check for metrics
echo -n "Checking for metrics endpoint... "
if grep -r "/metrics" rust/src --include="*.rs" > /dev/null; then
    echo "‚úÖ FOUND"
else
    echo "‚ùå MISSING"
fi

# Check for tests
echo -n "Checking test coverage... "
test_count=$(find tests -name "*.rs" -o -name "*.sh" | wc -l)
echo "Test files: $test_count"

echo "=== Check Complete ==="
```

## üìä Production Metrics to Track

### System Metrics
- CPU usage (< 80%)
- Memory usage (< 80%)
- Disk I/O (< 1000 IOPS)
- Network I/O (< 100 Mbps)
- Open file descriptors (< 1000)
- Thread count (< 100)

### Application Metrics
- Request rate (ops/sec)
- Error rate (< 1%)
- Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Active connections
- Queue depth
- Cache hit rate

### Business Metrics
- Active users
- Operations per user
- Data volume processed
- Vector searches performed
- Collections created
- Storage used

## üéØ Minimum Viable Production

If you need to go to production ASAP, these are the absolute minimums:

1. **No data loss** - Implement basic journaling
2. **No crashes** - Fix all panics
3. **Secure** - Basic auth + input validation
4. **Observable** - Logs + basic metrics
5. **Recoverable** - Backup + restore procedure
6. **Documented** - How to deploy and troubleshoot

Everything else can be improved iteratively in production.
