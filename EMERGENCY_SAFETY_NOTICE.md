# üö® SAFETY NOTICE - VexFS Kernel Module Development Status

## CURRENT STATUS: NOT PRODUCTION READY

**REALITY CHECK**: VexFS kernel module is in early development and has known critical issues.

**WHAT WORKS**:
- ‚úÖ Kernel module builds successfully
- ‚úÖ Module can be loaded/unloaded in VMs (safe version)
- ‚úÖ Basic C-only functionality

**WHAT DOESN'T WORK**:
- ‚ùå Mounting filesystems causes system hangs
- ‚ùå FFI functions are not implemented
- ‚ùå VFS operations are incomplete stubs
- ‚ùå No actual filesystem functionality

## Known Critical Issues

1. **FFI Implementation Missing**: Rust FFI functions called by kernel module are not implemented
2. **VFS Operations Incomplete**: File operations are stubs that don't work
3. **Memory Management Issues**: Incorrect kernel memory handling
4. **No Filesystem Logic**: No actual VexFS filesystem implementation

## Safe Development Protocol

**SAFE ACTIONS**:
- ‚úÖ Build kernel module on host systems
- ‚úÖ Load/unload safe module in VMs only
- ‚úÖ Develop and test individual components

**UNSAFE ACTIONS**:
- ‚ùå Never mount VexFS filesystems (causes hangs)
- ‚ùå Never load original module (has FFI issues)
- ‚ùå Never test on host systems

## Development Roadmap Required

This is a development project that needs:
1. Complete FFI implementation
2. Full VFS operation implementation
3. Actual filesystem logic
4. Comprehensive testing
5. Performance optimization

## Current Development Tools

- `Makefile.safe` - Builds safe version for testing
- `test_env/safe_kernel_test.sh` - VM-only testing
- `kernel/vexfs_module_entry_safe.c` - Safe version without FFI
