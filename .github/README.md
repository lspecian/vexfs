# VexFS CI/CD Pipeline

This directory contains the complete CI/CD pipeline implementation for VexFS, providing automated testing, validation, and deployment workflows using GitHub Actions.

## Overview

The VexFS CI/CD pipeline is designed to ensure the highest quality and reliability for the VexFS kernel module and associated components. It integrates with the comprehensive VM-based testing infrastructure implemented in Task 33 subtasks.

## Workflows

### 1. Quick Validation (`quick-validation.yml`)

**Purpose**: Fast feedback on basic build and test validation  
**Triggers**: Push to any branch, Pull requests  
**Duration**: ~20 minutes  
**Components**:
- Kernel module build validation
- Rust component compilation
- Basic unit tests
- Code formatting and linting

### 2. Main CI Pipeline (`vexfs-ci.yml`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive testing with parallel execution  
**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests, Manual dispatch, Scheduled  
**Duration**: ~3-4 hours  
**Components**:
- **Build and Validation**: Kernel module + Rust components
- **VM Testing**: 3-level testing (basic, mount operations, stress)
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Kernel vs FUSE comparison
- **xfstests Integration**: Filesystem compatibility testing
- **Syzkaller Fuzzing**: Security vulnerability detection
- **eBPF Tracing**: Runtime behavior analysis
- **Avocado-VT Orchestration**: Comprehensive test coordination
- **Results Aggregation**: Unified reporting and notifications

### 3. Nightly Comprehensive (`nightly-comprehensive.yml`)

**Purpose**: Extended testing with performance regression analysis  
**Triggers**: Scheduled (2 AM UTC), Manual dispatch  
**Duration**: ~6-8 hours  
**Components**:
- Extended VM testing (basic, stress, endurance)
- Performance regression testing (5 iterations)
- Extended Syzkaller fuzzing (2-3 hours)
- Memory safety validation with Miri
- Comprehensive results analysis
- Automated issue creation on failures

### 4. Release Testing (`release-testing.yml`)

**Purpose**: Pre-release validation and packaging  
**Triggers**: Tags, Releases, Manual dispatch  
**Duration**: ~4-6 hours  
**Components**:
- Pre-release validation
- Comprehensive release testing (stability, performance, compatibility, stress)
- Security and fuzzing validation
- Release documentation and packaging
- GitHub release creation

## Integration with Task 33 Infrastructure

The CI/CD pipeline leverages all components from Task 33 (Advanced VM-Based Testing Infrastructure):

### Task 33.2: Performance Benchmarking
- Integrated via `vexfs_performance_benchmark.sh`
- Automated kernel vs FUSE performance comparison
- Regression analysis across multiple iterations

### Task 33.3: xfstests Integration
- Automated via `setup_xfstests.sh` and `run_vexfs_xfstests.sh`
- Filesystem compatibility validation
- Integration with standard filesystem test suites

### Task 33.4: Syzkaller Fuzzing
- Automated via `setup_syzkaller_auto.sh`
- Security vulnerability detection
- Extended fuzzing for release validation

### Task 33.5: eBPF Tracing
- Integrated via `setup_ebpf_tracing.sh` and `run_vexfs_tracing.sh`
- Runtime behavior analysis
- Performance profiling and debugging

### Task 33.6: Avocado-VT Orchestration
- Comprehensive test coordination via `run_vexfs_orchestration.sh`
- Edge case and stress testing scenarios
- Automated VM lifecycle management

## Parallel Execution Strategy

The pipeline uses GitHub Actions matrix strategy for parallel execution:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    test-level: [1, 2, 3]        # VM testing levels
    test-type: [stability, performance, compatibility, stress]  # Release testing
    test-suite: [basic, stress, endurance]  # Nightly testing
```

This approach reduces total execution time while maintaining comprehensive coverage.

- Detailed failure analysis and logs
- Actionable recommendations for fixes

### Status Checks
- GitHub status checks for all workflows
- Branch protection integration
- Merge blocking on test failures

## Configuration and Management

### CI/CD Management Script
Use `.github/scripts/ci-config.sh` for pipeline management:

```bash
# Validate workflow configurations
.github/scripts/ci-config.sh validate

# Show pipeline status
.github/scripts/ci-config.sh status

# Setup local testing environment
.github/scripts/ci-config.sh setup

# Run local CI simulation
.github/scripts/ci-config.sh test-local

# Clean artifacts and caches
.github/scripts/ci-config.sh clean

# Monitor active workflows
.github/scripts/ci-config.sh monitor

# Generate performance report
.github/scripts/ci-config.sh report
```

### Local Testing with Act

The pipeline supports local testing using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act):

```bash
# Install act (done by ci-config.sh setup)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash

# Run quick validation locally
act -W .github/workflows/quick-validation.yml

# Run specific job
act -j build

# Use custom configuration
act --env-file .ci/act.yml
```

## Environment Variables

### Required for Full Functionality
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: For GitHub API access
- `VEXFS_CI`: Set to `true` in CI environment
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Directory for test results

### Optional Configuration
- `RUST_LOG`: Rust logging level (debug, info, warn, error)
- `VEXFS_TEST_CONFIG`: Custom test configuration file
- `VEXFS_NIGHTLY`: Set to `true` for nightly runs
- `VEXFS_RELEASE`: Set to `true` for release builds

## Performance Characteristics

### Resource Usage
- **CPU**: 2-4 cores per job (configurable)
- **Memory**: 2-8 GB depending on test type
- **Storage**: 10-50 GB for VM images and artifacts
- **Network**: Moderate (ISO downloads, artifact uploads)

### Execution Times
- **Quick Validation**: 15-25 minutes
- **Main CI Pipeline**: 3-4 hours (parallel execution)
- **Nightly Comprehensive**: 6-8 hours
- **Release Testing**: 4-6 hours

### Cost Optimization
- Parallel execution reduces wall-clock time
- Artifact caching minimizes redundant builds
- Conditional execution based on file changes
- Cleanup jobs prevent storage accumulation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **VM Boot Failures**
   - Check QEMU installation and KVM support
   - Verify sufficient disk space for VM images
   - Review VM setup scripts for errors

2. **Test Timeouts**
   - Increase timeout values in workflow files
   - Check for infinite loops in test scripts
   - Monitor resource usage during execution

3. **Artifact Upload Failures**
   - Verify artifact paths exist
   - Check GitHub storage limits
   - Ensure proper permissions

4. **Performance Regressions**
   - Review baseline performance data
   - Check for environmental changes
   - Analyze performance trend data

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by setting environment variables:

```yaml
env:
  RUST_LOG: debug
  VEXFS_DEBUG: true
  GITHUB_ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
```

### Log Analysis

Workflow logs are structured for easy analysis:
- Timestamps for all operations
- Color-coded output for status
- Detailed error messages with context
- Artifact references for deep investigation

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
- No hardcoded secrets in workflow files
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Audit secret access logs

### VM Security
- Isolated VM environments for testing
- No persistent state between runs
- Secure VM image sources
- Network isolation where possible

### Artifact Security
- Signed artifacts for releases
- Checksum validation
- Secure artifact storage
- Access logging and monitoring

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Multi-architecture Testing**: ARM64, RISC-V support
2. **Container-based Testing**: Docker/Podman integration
3. **Cloud Testing**: AWS/GCP/Azure runners
4. **Advanced Analytics**: ML-based failure prediction
5. **Integration Testing**: Real-world workload simulation

### Monitoring and Metrics
1. **Performance Dashboards**: Grafana integration
2. **Alerting**: PagerDuty/Slack notifications
3. **Trend Analysis**: Historical performance tracking
4. **Capacity Planning**: Resource usage optimization
