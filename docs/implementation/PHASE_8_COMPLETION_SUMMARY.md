  - Online/offline status monitoring
  - Connection quality assessment
  - Slow connection detection
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
  - Network error recovery mechanisms

### 6. **Enhanced API Service**
- **enhancedVexfsApi.ts**: Created robust API service with:
  - Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Comprehensive error handling and classification
  - Request/response interceptors for logging
  - Network error detection and recovery
  - Configurable timeout and retry settings

### 7. **List Virtualization**
- **VirtualizedCollectionsList.tsx**: Implemented react-window for large datasets
  - Efficient rendering of large collections lists
  - Memoized row components for optimal performance
  - Maintained all existing functionality (search, sort, pagination)

### 8. **Code Splitting and Bundle Optimization**
- Implemented lazy loading for all major components
- Reduced initial bundle size through code splitting
- Optimized import statements for better tree shaking
