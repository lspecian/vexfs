### 🔧 Technical Architecture

#### Two-Phase Commit Protocol
```c
// Kernel implementation provides:
int vexfs_cross_layer_begin(struct vexfs_cross_layer_manager *manager, 
                           u32 operation_mask, u32 isolation_level, 
                           u64 timeout_ms, u64 *transaction_id);
int vexfs_cross_layer_prepare(struct vexfs_cross_layer_manager *manager, 
                             u64 transaction_id);
int vexfs_cross_layer_commit(struct vexfs_cross_layer_manager *manager, 
                            u64 transaction_id);
int vexfs_cross_layer_abort(struct vexfs_cross_layer_manager *manager, 
                           u64 transaction_id);
```

#### Rust Coordinator
```rust
// Userspace coordinator provides:
pub async fn begin_transaction(&self, operation_mask: u32, 
                              isolation_level: CrossLayerIsolationLevel, 
                              timeout_ms: Option<u64>) -> Result<Uuid, VexFSError>;
pub async fn commit_transaction(&self, transaction_id: Uuid) -> Result<(), VexFSError>;
pub async fn abort_transaction(&self, transaction_id: Uuid) -> Result<(), VexFSError>;
```

#### Background Tasks
- **Consistency Checker**: Periodic verification of cross-layer consistency
- **Deadlock Detector**: Cycle detection in transaction wait-for graphs
- **Recovery Processor**: Automatic recovery from failed transactions
- **Event Processor**: Handles cross-layer events and notifications
- **Command Processor**: Executes control commands and operations

### 📊 Performance Features

#### Statistics Tracking
- Total transactions, successful commits, failed commits
- Active transaction count and deadlock detection
- Consistency checks and violations
- Recovery operations and layer-specific errors
- Average transaction and commit times
- Cache hit rates and deadlock rates

#### Memory Management
- Kernel caches for frequent allocations
- Efficient crossbeam channels for inter-thread communication
- Lock-free data structures where possible
- Proper cleanup and resource management

### 🔄 Integration Points

#### Layer Coordination
1. **FS Journal Layer**: ACID-compliant journaling with transaction support
2. **VexGraph Layer**: Graph operations with API management
3. **Semantic Journal Layer**: Event sourcing with semantic operations
4. **Cross-Layer Manager**: Coordinates transactions across all layers

#### Communication Channels
- Kernel-to-userspace via ioctl interface
- Inter-thread communication via crossbeam channels
- Event-driven notifications for consistency violations
- Background task coordination with wait groups

### ⚠️ Known Dependencies

The implementation requires the following dependencies to be added to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
crossbeam = "0.8"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
tracing = "0.1"
uuid = { version = "1.0", features = ["v4", "serde"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }

[dev-dependencies]
criterion = "0.5"
