# Vector Caching Implementation for VexFS

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive vector caching system implemented for VexFS as part of Task 9. The caching system provides significant performance improvements for vector operations through intelligent caching strategies, multiple eviction policies, prefetching mechanisms, and cache coherence protocols.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. VectorCacheManager
The main cache manager that orchestrates all caching operations:
- **Vector Cache**: Stores decompressed vector data with metadata
- **Index Cache**: Caches ANNS index segments for faster search operations
- **Access Pattern Tracker**: Monitors access patterns for predictive prefetching
- **Memory Pressure Monitor**: Adapts cache behavior based on available memory

#### 2. Cache Entry Types

**VectorCacheEntry**:
- Vector ID and associated file inode
- Vector header with compression metadata
- Decompressed vector data
- Cache state (Clean, Dirty, Locked, Invalid)
- Access statistics (count, frequency, last access)
- Reference counting for pinning
- Prefetch priority scoring
- Compression ratio tracking

**IndexCacheEntry**:
- Index segment identifier and associated inode
- HNSW index segment data
- Cache state and access statistics
- Level information (base layer vs. upper layers)
- Connection count for value-based eviction

#### 3. Eviction Policies

**LRU (Least Recently Used)**:
- Evicts entries based on last access time
- Simple and effective for temporal locality
- Best for workloads with clear temporal patterns

**LFU (Least Frequently Used)**:
- Evicts entries based on access frequency
- Effective for workloads with stable hot sets
- Prevents cache pollution from one-time accesses

**ARC (Adaptive Replacement Cache)**:
- Combines LRU and LFU strategies
- Adapts to workload characteristics
- Balances recency and frequency
- Default policy for optimal general performance

**Value-Based Eviction**:
- Uses composite scoring considering:
  - Access frequency and recency
  - Entry size (smaller entries preferred)
  - Compression ratio (better compressed data preferred)
  - Prefetch priority
- Most sophisticated policy for complex workloads

#### 4. Prefetching Strategies

**Sequential Prefetching**:
- Prefetches vectors in sequential order
- Effective for scan operations
- Low overhead implementation

**Spatial Prefetching**:
- Prefetches spatially related vectors
- Uses co-occurrence patterns in access history
- Builds spatial locality maps

**Predictive Prefetching**:
- Uses machine learning-like pattern recognition
- Analyzes temporal access sequences
- Predicts next likely accesses

**Hybrid Prefetching** (Default):
- Combines multiple strategies
- Adapts based on detected access patterns
- Provides best overall performance

#### 5. Cache Coherence Modes

**Write-Through**:
- Immediately writes changes to storage
- Ensures data consistency
- Higher write latency but safer

**Write-Back**:
- Batches writes for better performance
- Marks entries as dirty
- Periodic flush operations
- Default mode for optimal performance

**Invalidation-Based**:
- Invalidates cache entries on writes
- Ensures consistency through cache misses
- Lower memory usage

**None**:
- No coherence guarantees
- Highest performance for read-only workloads

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Memory Management
- **Adaptive Memory Pressure Handling**: Monitors memory usage and triggers aggressive eviction when needed
- **Compression-Aware Caching**: Prioritizes well-compressed data to maximize cache efficiency
- **Reference Counting**: Prevents eviction of actively used entries

### 2. Access Pattern Learning
- **Frequency Tracking**: Maintains access frequency maps for LFU decisions
- **Spatial Locality Detection**: Builds co-occurrence maps for spatial prefetching
- **Temporal Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common access sequences

### 3. Cache Warming
- **Startup Optimization**: Pre-loads frequently accessed vectors
- **Background Loading**: Asynchronous cache population
- **Priority-Based Loading**: Loads high-value entries first

### 4. Latency Optimization
- **Lock-Free Operations**: Minimizes contention in hot paths
- **Batch Processing**: Groups operations for efficiency
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Defers expensive operations when possible

## Integration Points

### 1. VectorStorageManager Integration
The `VectorCacheIntegration` struct provides seamless integration:
- **Transparent Caching**: Applications use the same API
- **Cache-First Reads**: Checks cache before storage access
- **Coherent Writes**: Maintains consistency between cache and storage
- **Automatic Invalidation**: Handles cache invalidation on deletes

### 2. ANNS Integration
- **Index Segment Caching**: Caches frequently accessed HNSW segments
- **Level-Aware Caching**: Prioritizes base layer segments
- **Search Optimization**: Reduces index traversal latency

### 3. OperationContext Integration
- **Consistent State Management**: Uses established VexFS patterns
- **Transaction Support**: Integrates with transaction boundaries
- **Error Handling**: Follows VexFS error handling conventions

## Configuration

### Default Configuration
```rust
VectorCacheConfig {
    max_size: 5000 * 1024,              // 5MB default cache size
    max_entries: 5000,                   // Maximum cached entries
    eviction_policy: EvictionPolicy::ARC, // Adaptive replacement cache
    prefetch_strategy: PrefetchStrategy::Hybrid, // Combined strategies
    coherence_mode: CoherenceMode::WriteBack,    // Optimal performance
    enable_compression: true,            // Compression-aware caching
    memory_pressure_threshold: 0.8,     // 80% memory pressure threshold
    prefetch_batch_size: 8,             // Prefetch batch size
    enable_cache_warming: true,         // Enable cache warming
}
```
