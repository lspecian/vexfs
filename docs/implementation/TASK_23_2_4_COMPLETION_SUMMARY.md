**Created `task_23_2_4_comprehensive_integration_test.rs`:**
- **End-to-End Integration Testing**: Complete workflows testing store vectors → search vectors → sync operations
- **Stack Safety Validation**: Monitoring and verification that stack usage remains below 6KB target
- **Performance Validation**: Verification that all operations meet Task 23.1 performance targets
- **Functional Validation**: Testing vector storage/retrieval accuracy, search quality, and data consistency
- **Stress Testing**: Large-scale testing with 1000+ vectors, concurrent operations, and memory pressure scenarios
- **FUSE Operations Integration**: Validation that vector operations don't interfere with normal file operations

**Test Configuration:**
```rust
pub struct IntegrationTestConfig {
    pub max_test_vectors: usize,        // 1000 for comprehensive testing
    pub vector_dimensions: usize,       // 128 standard dimensions
