# VexFS Testing Status

## Current Situation

The VexFS kernel module has been fixed but cannot be tested on the host system because:
- The previous module is stuck loaded with `refcount=2` due to a kernel crash
- This prevents loading the new fixed module
- System requires reboot to clear the stuck module

## What Was Fixed

1. **Kernel BUG at fs/buffer.c:1316** - FIXED ✅
   - Removed `spin_lock_irqsave(&sbi->bitmap_lock, flags)` from `vexfs_alloc_inode_num()`
   - The spinlock was causing crashes because `sb_bread()` can sleep
   - Fix location: `kernel_module/core/block.c`

2. **Directory Operations** - IMPLEMENTED ✅
   - Custom `readdir` implementation that works with disk storage
   - Fix location: `kernel_module/core/dir_fix.c`

3. **File Persistence** - ENHANCED ✅
   - Proper block allocation and mapping
   - Immediate writeback for durability
   - Fix location: `kernel_module/core/file_enhanced.c`

## Testing Infrastructure Ready

### 1. Alpine Linux VM ✅
- Lightweight VM (50MB vs Ubuntu's 1.5GB)
- Complete isolation for safe kernel testing
- All scripts and tests prepared in `vm_testing/`

### 2. Test Scripts ✅
- `/mnt/shared/run_all_tests.sh` - Comprehensive test suite
- `/mnt/shared/test_vexfs_alpine.sh` - Basic functionality test
- `automated_vm_test_runner.sh` - SSH-based automated testing

### 3. Fixed Module ✅
- `kernel_module/vexfs_deadlock_fix.ko` - Ready for testing
- Already copied to VM shared directory

## How to Test

### Option 1: After System Reboot (Recommended)
```bash
# After rebooting to clear stuck module
cd /home/luis/Development/oss/vexfs
sudo insmod kernel_module/vexfs_deadlock_fix.ko
# Run persistence tests...
```

### Option 2: Using Alpine VM (Safe, No Reboot Needed)
```bash
# Start the VM
./vm_testing/scripts/start_alpine_vm.sh

# At login prompt, login as: root (no password)
# Run: /mnt/shared/setup_alpine_auto.sh

# After VM reboots, connect via SSH:
ssh -p 2222 root@localhost  # password: vexfs

# Run comprehensive tests:
/mnt/shared/run_all_tests.sh
```

### Option 3: Automated Testing (After VM Setup)
```bash
# If VM is already set up:
./vm_testing/scripts/automated_vm_test_runner.sh
```

## Expected Test Results

The fixed module should:
1. ✅ Load without kernel panic
2. ✅ Register filesystem successfully
3. ✅ Mount without crashes (previously crashed here)
4. ✅ Create files and directories
5. ✅ **Persist files across unmount/remount** (main goal)
6. ✅ Handle multiple files and stress tests

## Why VM Testing?

The VM provides:
- Complete isolation from host system
- Safe environment for kernel crashes
- Easy reset if something goes wrong
- Ability to test without rebooting host

## Test Verification

After testing, check:
- No kernel panics in `dmesg`
- Files persist after unmount/remount
- Module loads/unloads cleanly
- All test cases pass

## Current Blocker

**The host system has a stuck module (refcount=2) that prevents testing.**

Solutions:
1. Reboot the system (clears stuck module)
2. Use the Alpine VM (no reboot needed)

The VM is the recommended approach since it's already set up and provides a safe testing environment.
