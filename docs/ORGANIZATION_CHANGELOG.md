# VexFS Project Organization Changelog

## Date: December 15, 2024

### Summary
Reorganized the VexFS project structure for better maintainability and clarity.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Created New Directory Structure
- `tests/` - Centralized all test-related files
  - `images/` - Test disk images (gitignored)
  - `scripts/` - Test scripts organized by type
  - `data/` - Test data files
  - `results/` - Test output (gitignored)
- `scripts/` - Development and automation scripts
  - `build/` - Build-related scripts
  - `testing/` - Test automation scripts
  - `cleanup/` - Maintenance scripts
- `docs/testing/` - Testing-specific documentation

#### 2. Moved Files
**From root to `tests/images/`:**
- All `test_*.img` files (7 files total)

**From root to `scripts/testing/`:**
- `cleanup_and_test.sh`
- `quick_verify.sh`
- `run_test.sh`
- `test_module_local.sh`
- `verify_fix_implementation.sh`

**From root to `scripts/build/`:**
- `verify_build.sh`

**From root to `docs/testing/`:**
- `test_status_summary.md`
- `TESTING_STATUS.md`
- `VEXFS_VM_TEST_REPORT.md`

#### 3. Cleaned Up
- Removed `vexfs.ko` and `.vexfs.mod.cmd` from root
- Removed duplicate `mkfs.vexfs` from `vm_testing/shared/`
- Consolidated test images in one location

#### 4. Updated .gitignore
- Reorganized into clear sections
- Added proper patterns for new directory structure
- Included explicit keep rules for important files

### Benefits
1. **Cleaner root directory** - Only essential files remain
2. **Logical organization** - Related files grouped together
3. **Better gitignore** - Prevents accidental commits of build artifacts
4. **Easier navigation** - Clear directory purposes
5. **Scalability** - Structure supports project growth

### Next Steps
- Update any scripts that reference moved files
- Update CI/CD pipelines if needed
- Ensure all developers are aware of new structure
