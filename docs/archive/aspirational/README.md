# Aspirational Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation that was written for features that were planned but never implemented, or that contains performance claims that are not backed by actual benchmarks.

## What's Here

### Performance Claims
- `performance_claims.md` - Claims 361K+ ops/sec, 100K vectors/sec insertion
- `VEXFS_V2_PERFORMANCE_BREAKTHROUGH_REPORT.md` - Performance breakthrough claims
- `performance_guide/` - Detailed performance optimization guide for non-existent features

### API Compatibility
- `chromadb.md` - Claims "100% API compatibility" with ChromaDB
- `api-reference.md` - Detailed API docs for non-existent endpoints
- `VEXFS_V2_API_COMPATIBILITY_SPECIFICATION.md` - Full API compatibility spec

### Production Readiness
- `production.md` - Production deployment guide
- `production-deployment.md` - Detailed production ops
- `TASK_23_8_PRODUCTION_OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md` - Production operations guide
- `PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT.md` - Claims production readiness

### Features That Don't Exist
- `vector-search.md` - Tutorial for non-existent vector search
- AI-native filesystem capabilities
- Distributed deployment
- Real-time indexing
- Multi-model support

## Why These Are Archived

These documents were written during the planning phase or represent aspirational goals. They contain:

1. **False Performance Claims**: Numbers like 361K ops/sec that have never been benchmarked
2. **Non-existent Features**: Vector search, AI capabilities, API compatibility
3. **Production Claims**: The system is alpha-quality, not production-ready
4. **Implementation Details**: For code that was never written

## Current Reality

For the actual state of VexFS, see:
- `/ACTUAL_PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Honest assessment
- `/kernel_module/README.md` - What actually exists
- `/docs/testing/VEXFS_VM_TEST_REPORT.md` - Real test results

VexFS is an experimental filesystem project that:
- Has a kernel module that crashes with NULL pointer dereferences
- Has a FUSE implementation that might work for basic operations
- Has no vector search capabilities
- Has no performance benchmarks
- Is not production-ready

These aspirational documents are kept for historical reference and to understand the original vision, but should not be confused with the current implementation.
