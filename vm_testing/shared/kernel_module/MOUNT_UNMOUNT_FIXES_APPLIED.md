# VexFS Mount/Unmount Crash Fixes Applied

## Summary
Successfully applied manual fixes to prevent mount/unmount crashes in VexFS kernel module.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced `vexfs_put_super` cleanup (core/superblock.c)
- Added NULL check with warning message for sb_info
- Added proper buffer synchronization before release:
  - `mark_buffer_dirty(sbi->sb_bh)`
  - `sync_dirty_buffer(sbi->sb_bh)`
- Improved logging messages for better debugging

### 2. Proper cleanup in `vexfs_kill_sb` (core/main.c)
- Already had `sync_filesystem(sb)` to ensure pending I/O completion
- Already had `sb->s_flags |= SB_ACTIVE` to ensure proper cleanup
- Note: `invalidate_inodes()` is not available in modern kernels (6.11.x)

### 3. Inode initialization in `vexfs_create` (core/inode.c)
- Already properly implemented:
  - Sets `inode->i_state |= I_NEW`
  - Calls `insert_inode_hash(inode)`
  - Calls `unlock_new_inode(inode)`
  - Properly handles error cases with `drop_nlink()`

## Build Status
✅ Module builds successfully with all fixes applied
✅ No compilation errors
⚠️ Some warnings present (unused variables, missing prototypes) but not critical

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test module load/unload cycles
2. Test mount/unmount operations with and without data
3. Test file operations between mount cycles
4. Monitor dmesg for any error messages during operations
