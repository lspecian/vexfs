# VexFS Vector Embedding Storage Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Task 4: Vector Embedding Storage for the VDBHAX/VexFS kernel module. This implementation provides the core vector storage capabilities that make VexFS vector-native.

## Architecture

The vector storage system consists of several key components:

### 1. Vector On-Disk Format (`VectorHeader`)
- **Size**: Exactly 64 bytes for cache-line alignment
- **Magic Number**: `0x56454354` ("VECT") for format validation
- **Version**: Format version for future compatibility
- **Metadata**: Comprehensive metadata including timestamps, checksums, and compression info

### 2. Storage Allocation (`VectorStorageManager`)
- Vector-specific allocation strategies to minimize fragmentation
- Block-based allocation with configurable block sizes
- Memory alignment for optimal performance
- Efficient space tracking and management

### 3. File-to-Embedding Linking (`VectorIndex`)
- Bidirectional mapping between files and their vector embeddings
- Hash-based indexing for fast lookups
- Support for multiple vectors per file
- Efficient iteration over all vectors

### 4. Vector Metadata Management
- Storage and indexing of vector metadata (model version, confidence, etc.)
- Support for different data types (Float32, Float16, Int8, Int16, Binary)
- Compression metadata tracking

### 5. Serialization and Compression
- Multiple compression algorithms:
  - 4-bit and 8-bit quantization
  - Product quantization
  - Sparse encoding (for future sparse vector support)
- Efficient binary serialization with integrity verification

## Key Features

### Memory Alignment
- All vector data is aligned to 32-byte boundaries for SIMD optimization
- Headers are exactly 64 bytes for cache-line alignment
- Allocation strategies account for alignment requirements

### Data Integrity
- CRC32 checksums for all vector data
- Magic number validation for format verification
- Version checking for compatibility

### Compression Support
- Multiple compression algorithms supported
- Maintains original size information for decompression
- Pluggable compression architecture

### Performance Optimizations
- Block-based allocation reduces fragmentation
- Cache-friendly data structures
- Efficient indexing for fast lookups
- Memory-mapped access patterns

## Data Structures

### VectorHeader (64 bytes)
```rust
struct VectorHeader {
    magic: u32,              // Format magic number
    version: u32,            // Format version
    vector_id: u64,          // Unique vector identifier
    file_inode: u64,         // Associated file inode
    data_type: VectorDataType, // Vector data type
    compression: CompressionType, // Compression algorithm
    dimensions: u32,         // Vector dimensions
    original_size: u32,      // Original data size
    compressed_size: u32,    // Compressed data size
    created_timestamp: u64,  // Creation timestamp
    modified_timestamp: u64, // Last modification timestamp
    checksum: u32,           // Data integrity checksum
    flags: u32,              // Additional flags
}
```

### VectorStorageManager
- Manages vector allocation and storage
- Tracks free space and allocated blocks
- Provides methods for storing, loading, and deleting vectors
- Handles compression and decompression

### VectorIndex
- Maintains file-to-vector mappings
- Supports efficient lookups by file inode or vector ID
- Handles multiple vectors per file
- Provides iteration capabilities

## Usage Example

```rust
// Create storage manager
let storage = VectorStorageManager::new(block_size)?;

// Store a vector
let vector_data = vec![1.0f32; 512]; // 512-dimensional vector
let vector_id = storage.store_vector(
    file_inode,
    &vector_data,
    VectorDataType::Float32,
    CompressionType::Quantization8Bit
)?;

// Load a vector
let loaded_vector = storage.load_vector(vector_id)?;

// Create index for fast lookups
let mut index = VectorIndex::new();
index.add_mapping(file_inode, vector_id);

// Find vectors for a file
let vectors = index.get_vectors_for_file(file_inode);
```

## Integration Points

This vector storage system integrates with:
- **Inode Management**: Associates vectors with file inodes
- **Space Allocation**: Uses VexFS space allocation for vector blocks
- **Journal System**: Transactions for vector operations
- **File Operations**: Vector attachment/detachment during file ops

The implementation establishes the foundation for VexFS's vector-native capabilities and is ready for integration with the broader VexFS ecosystem.
