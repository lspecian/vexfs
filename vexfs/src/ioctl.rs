// IOCTL definitions for VexFS

use kernel::prelude::*;
// If using specific ioctl number generation helpers from a crate, import them here.
// For manual definition matching userspace:
// Magic number for VexFS IOCTLs
pub const VEXFS_IOCTL_MAGIC: u8 = b'v';
// Command number for GET_STATUS
pub const VEXFS_IOCTL_CMD_GET_STATUS: u8 = 0x01;

// If we were to define the full IOCTL number as it would appear in C using _IO, _IOR, _IOW:
// For an IOCTL that returns an int directly (like our GET_STATUS is intended to),
// it's often defined with _IO for "no data transfer" or _IOR if the int is considered "read".
// However, the kernel handler itself just returns `long` (or `int`), and the VFS takes care of it.
// The userspace `ioctl()` call's return value will be this `long`.
// So, the command number itself doesn't need to encode the size of `int` in this specific case.
// What matters is that the userspace `ioctl()` call uses the correct number
// and interprets the direct return value of the syscall.

// Example of a function that might be called by the ioctl handler.
// For now, the logic is simple and can be in the handler itself in inode.rs.
// pub fn get_status_value() -> i32 {
//     // In a real scenario, this might check filesystem state, counters, etc.
//     12345 // A dummy status value
// }

// Note: The actual IOCTL command handling logic (the function that gets called
// when an ioctl is performed on a VexFS file/directory) will be in `inode.rs`
// or `file.rs` as part of the `FileOperations` or `InodeOperations` struct.
// This file primarily serves to define the command numbers if they become complex
// or if we add helper functions related to ioctl data structures later.
// For now, it just centralizes the magic and command constants.

// If we need to pass complex data structures, we'd define them here as well.
// #[repr(C)]
// pub struct VexfsIoctlStatusData {
//     pub version_major: u32,
//     pub version_minor: u32,
//     pub status_flags: u64,
// }
