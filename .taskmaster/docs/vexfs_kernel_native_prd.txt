VexFS v2.0: Full Kernel-Native Vector Filesystem Implementation

PROJECT CONTEXT:
This PRD defines VexFS v2.0, a third implementation alongside our existing:
1. VexFS-FUSE: Userspace implementation with vector operations (4,089 ops/sec vector insert, 21,607 ops/sec basic files)
2. VexFS-KFixed: Minimal kernel module with basic file operations (54,530 ops/sec create, 84,508 ops/sec read)

VexFS v2.0 will be a COMPLETE kernel-native vector filesystem that combines the performance advantages of our kernel module with the vector database capabilities of our FUSE implementation, targeting 100,000+ ops/sec for both basic operations AND vector operations.

EXISTING CODEBASE FOUNDATION:
- Proven kernel module architecture in kernel/vexfs_fixed_build/
- Working FUSE vector operations in src/fuse_impl.rs
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure (Docker, GitHub Actions)
- Performance benchmarking tools
- Real block device formatting with mkfs.vexfs utility
- Dual licensing (GPL v2 for kernel, Apache 2.0 for userspace)

1. Introduction to VexFS v2.0: Full Kernel-Native Vector Database

1.1. Defining VexFS v2.0: Building on Proven Foundations
VexFS v2.0 represents the evolution of our successful dual-implementation approach into a unified, high-performance kernel-native vector filesystem. Unlike general-purpose filesystems that treat file contents as undifferentiated byte streams, VexFS v2.0 will possess intrinsic understanding of vector data structures and their computational access patterns.

Building on our proven kernel module foundation (vexfs_fixed.c) that already achieves 54,530 ops/sec for basic file operations, VexFS v2.0 will integrate the vector database capabilities from our FUSE implementation to create a complete in-kernel vector database filesystem.

Key differentiators from existing implementations:
- Extends our proven kernel module architecture with vector-native operations
- Integrates SIMD-optimized vector computations directly in kernel space
- Maintains compatibility with our existing mkfs.vexfs formatting utility
- Leverages our established testing and benchmarking infrastructure
- Preserves the performance advantages we've demonstrated (2.5x faster than FUSE for basic operations)

1.2. Core Objectives: Maximum Performance Through Kernel Integration
Performance: Target 100,000+ ops/sec for both basic file operations AND vector operations by eliminating user-kernel context switches and leveraging in-kernel SIMD processing.

Scalability: Handle terabyte-scale vector datasets with efficient metadata management and concurrent access, building on our proven block device handling.

VFS Compliance: Maintain full POSIX compatibility while exposing vector-specific operations through ioctl interfaces, ensuring seamless integration with existing tools.

Backward Compatibility: Ensure VexFS v2.0 can read filesystems created by our existing mkfs.vexfs utility and coexist with our FUSE and minimal kernel implementations.

1.3. Technical Challenges: Kernel-Space Vector Database Implementation
Data Representation and SIMD Alignment: Efficiently represent high-dimensional vectors (float32, bfloat16, int8) with strict memory alignment for AVX2/AVX-512 SIMD instructions.

Vector-Specific Metadata: Extend our existing inode structure to include vector dimensionality, element type, normalization status, and index associations.

In-Kernel Vector Computations: Implement distance calculations (Euclidean, cosine similarity) and ANN algorithms (HNSW, Product Quantization) directly in kernel space using kernel_fpu_begin()/end() wrappers.

Memory Management: Optimize allocation strategies for large vector datasets using alloc_pages() for contiguous memory and NUMA-aware allocation.
