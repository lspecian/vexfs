Product Requirements Document: VDBHAX/VexFS (Kernel-Native)

1. Project Overview: VDBHAX/VexFS

1.1. Purpose and Vision
The VDBHAX/VexFS File System is conceived to address the escalating demand for efficient, integrated storage and retrieval solutions tailored to the unique needs of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications. The exponential growth of AI/ML has underscored the necessity for storage systems capable of handling vast quantities of vector and tensor data, which are fundamental to modern AI models like Large Language Models (LLMs).

Traditional file systems, while proficient at managing hierarchical data, are agnostic to the semantic content of the data they store. Conversely, vector databases have emerged as specialized "powerhouses" for managing and querying high-dimensional vector embeddings, enabling lightning-fast similarity searches. However, this bifurcation often leads to data silos, increased data movement, and complex application architectures.

The vision for VDBHAX/VexFS is to revolutionize how AI/ML applications interact with data by providing a file system that natively understands, stores, and manages vector embeddings directly alongside traditional file data, implemented as a Linux kernel module (VexFS) for maximum performance and integration. This approach aims to eliminate the impedance mismatch and operational overhead associated with synchronizing separate file systems and vector databases.

By integrating vector search capabilities at the file system level, VDBHAX/VexFS will simplify AI workflows, reduce data redundancy and movement, enhance data consistency, and ultimately improve the performance and scalability of AI-driven applications. The goal is to create a unified data substrate where the semantic meaning of data, represented by vectors, is a first-class citizen of the file system itself.

1.2. Core Goals
- Seamless Integration with Linux Ecosystem via Kernel Module: VDBHAX/VexFS will be implemented as a Linux kernel module, providing a POSIX-compliant interface and ensuring deep compatibility with existing Linux operating systems, standard command-line tools, and applications.
- Ultimate Performance for Hybrid Workloads: The file system will be optimized for both traditional file I/O operations and demanding vector search and retrieval tasks, leveraging its kernel-level implementation to minimize overhead.
- Unified Data Management: VDBHAX/VexFS will store and manage files and their corresponding vector embeddings within a single, cohesive system.
- Enhanced Developer Experience: The file system will offer intuitive and powerful APIs (primarily via ioctls and potentially client libraries) and command-line tools (e.g., vexctl) for managing, indexing, and querying vector data.
- Scalability across Multiple Dimensions: VDBHAX/VexFS will be designed to scale efficiently to handle large volumes of data.

1.3. Key Differentiating Features (Vector-Native Integration)
- Direct Vector Indexing of File Content: Files stored within VDBHAX/VexFS can have their content automatically processed to generate vector embeddings.
- Hybrid Queries via Extended File System API: VDBHAX/VexFS will support queries that combine traditional file metadata attributes with semantic similarity based on vector embeddings.
- Vector-Aware File Operations: Standard POSIX file operations will be augmented, or new operations will be introduced (e.g., via ioctls), to allow direct interaction with vector embeddings associated with files.
- Reduced Data Redundancy and Movement: By co-locating vector embeddings with their source data within the same storage system, VDBHAX/VexFS will minimize the need for data replication and movement.

1.4. Target Use Cases Overview
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for LLMs
- AI Model Data Storage and Retrieval
